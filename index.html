      <h1 align="left">These are a few of my favorite things</h1>
      <p align="left">Growing up, my favorite color was <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">GREEN</span>. As I've grown it has shifted more towards <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">BLUE</span>. Great colors for a sports team, like the Minnesota Timberwolves!</p>
      <p align="left">I also like musicals, as one may have noted from this section's heading. Here are a few I enjoy:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>The Music Man</li>
        <li>The Wizard of Oz</li>
        <li>Fiddler on the Roof</li>
        <li>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</li>
        <li>Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I have had the fortune of being able to travel a bit over the winter. Here I am snowboarding in Whitefish, Montana.</p>
